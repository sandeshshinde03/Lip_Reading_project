# Lip_Reading_project
 Lip Reading System Using Deep Learning  • Recognizes speech from visual lip movements using Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.  • Used video preprocessing, grayscale conversion, and frame extraction.  • Implemented CNN for feature extraction and LSTM for sequence modeling.  • Applied attention mechanisms and perplexity analysis for evaluation.
